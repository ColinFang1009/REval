You are given a Python function and a question on the function. Answer the question with only one line of code, considering executing the provided code on the given input, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Do NOT output any extra information. Think step by step. Your thoughts should be concise and contain no more than 10 steps. For loop logics, express your thoughts without detailing each iteration. Provide your answer in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.

[PYTHON]
def f(a, b):
    ans = a + b
    if ans > 0:
        ans = int(a)
    else:
        ans = b
    return ans

f(1.1, 2)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
If the line `        ans = int(a)` is executed when f(1.1, 2) is called, answer with the next line of code to be executed inside the function. Do NOT answer lines in the test code. If not or program terminates after this line, answer with -1.
[/QUESTION]
[THOUGHT]
1. Function f is called with arguments a=1.1 and b=2. Thus ans should be 1.1 + 2 = 3.1.
2. Since ans is greater than 0, line `ans = int(a)` is executed.
3. After this line, the program jumps out of the if block and returns ans. Thus, the answer should be return ans.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
return ans
[/ANSWER]

[PYTHON]
def f(a, b):
    ans = a + b
    if ans > 0:
        ans = int(a)
    else:
        ans = b
    return ans

f(1.1, -2)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
If the line `        ans = int(a)` is executed when f(1.1, -2) is called, answer with the next line of code to be executed inside the function. Do NOT answer lines in the test code. If not or program terminates after this line, answer with -1.
[/QUESTION]
[THOUGHT]
1. Function f is called with arguments a=1.1 and b=-2. Thus ans should be 1.1 - 2 = -0.9.
2. Since ans is not greater than 0, line `ans = b` is executed, while line `ans = int(a)` is not executed.
3. Thus the answer should be -1.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
-1
[/ANSWER]

[PYTHON]
class A:
    def f(self, x):
        z = self.g(x)
        return z
    
    def g(self, y):
        return y*2

a = A()
assertEqual(a.f(3), 6)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
If the line `        z = self.g(x)` is executed when the above test code is called, answer with the next line of code to be executed inside the function. Do NOT answer lines in the test code. If not or program terminates after this line, answer with -1.
[/QUESTION]
[THOUGHT]
1. Method f is called with argument x=3. Thus z should be self.g(3).
2. When `self.g(3)` is called, the program jumps to method g with argument y=3.
3. The first line of method g is `return y*2`. Thus the answer should be return y*2.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
return y*2
[/ANSWER]

[PYTHON]
{code}
{invocation}
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
If the line `{codeline}` is executed when {invocation_abbr} is called, answer with the next line of code to be executed inside the function. Do NOT answer lines in the test code. If not or program terminates after this line, answer with -1.
