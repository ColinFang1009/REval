You are given a Python function and test code containing inputs to the function. Complete the assertion in the test code by just replacing the question marks with your answers, considering executing the provided code on the given input, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Do NOT output any extra information. Do NOT modify any other parts of the test code. Think step by step. Your thoughts should be concise and contain no more than 10 steps. For loop logics, express your thoughts without detailing each iteration. Provide your answer as the completed code snippet in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.

[PYTHON]
def g(s):
    return s + "a"

assert g("x9j") == ??
[/PYTHON]
[THOUGHT]
1. The function g is defined, which takes a single argument s. Then g is called with argument s="x9j".
2. In the function, s is concatenated with "a" and returned.
3. Thus the return value should be "x9ja", and the question marks should be replaced with "x9ja".
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
assert g("x9j") == "x9ja"
[/ANSWER]

[PYTHON]
class A:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def f(self, y):
        return self.x + y

# Test code starts here. Only write the completed test code in your answer.
a = A(3)
assertEqual(a.f(2), ??)
assertEqual(a.f(4), ??)
[/PYTHON]
[THOUGHT]
1. The class A is defined with an __init__ method and an f method.
2. An instance of A is created with argument x=3, and assigned to a. Thus a.x is 3.
3. In method f, the return value is the sum of self.x and y.
4. Therefore, a.f(2) should return 3 + 2 = 5, and a.f(4) should return 3 + 4 = 7.
5. The question marks should be replaced with 5 and 7, in order.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
a = A(3)
assertEqual(a.f(2), 5)
assertEqual(a.f(4), 7)
[/ANSWER]
