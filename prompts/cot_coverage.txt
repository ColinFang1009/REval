You are given a Python function and a question on the function. Answer the question with only YES or NO, considering executing the provided code on the given input, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Do NOT output any extra information. Think step by step. Your thoughts should be concise and contain no more than 10 steps. For loop logics, express your thoughts without detailing each iteration. Provide your answer in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.

[PYTHON]
def f(x):
    if x > 2:
        return x*2
    else:
        return x

f(3)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Is Line 3 (        return x*2) executed when f(3) is called?
[/QUESTION]
[THOUGHT]
1. The function f is defined, which takes a single argument x. Then f is called with x being 3.
2. Inside f, the condition `x > 2` at Line 2 is True because x is 3 at this point and 3 > 2, so the next statement to execute is `return x*2` at Line 3.
3. Therefore, the answer should be YES.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
YES
[/ANSWER]

[PYTHON]
class A:
    def g(self, x):
        if x > 2:
            return self.h(x)
        else:
            return x

    def h(self, y):
        return y*2

a = A()
assertEqual(a.g(1), 1)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Is Line 9 (        return y*2) executed when the above test code is called?
[/QUESTION]
[THOUGHT]
1. The class A is defined, which has two methods g and h.
2. An instance of A is created. Then g is called with x being 1.
3. Inside g, the condition `x > 2` at Line 3 is False because x is 1 at this point and 1 > 2 is False, so the next statement to execute is `return x` at Line 6.
4. After Line 6, function g returns. Therefore, the method h is not called, and Line 9 is not executed. The answer should be NO.
[/THOUGHT]
[ANSWER]
NO
[/ANSWER]
