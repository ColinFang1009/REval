You are given a Python function and a question on the function. Answer the question in "value; type" format, considering executing the provided code on the given input, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Make sure the value is a valid Python constant and the type is a valid Python class name. There may be multiple answers, but you should only output one. Do NOT output any extra information. Provide your answer in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.

[PYTHON]
def f(a, b):
    ans = a + b
    if ans > 0:
        ans = int(a)
    else:
        ans = b
    return ans

f(1.1, 2)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Is Line 4 (        ans = int(a)) executed when f(1.1, 2) is called? If so, what is the value and type of the variable ans after Line 4 is executed? If not, answer Nil.
[/QUESTION]
[ANSWER]
1; int
